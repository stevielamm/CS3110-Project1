# CS3110-Project1
My program first prompts the user if they want to quit the program. If they do then they will press q and the program will quit. Then if the user does not want to quit the program then it will as the user to input a string. The program will accept any literal that ends with f and d and remove it from the string. It will also recognize if its an integer then it will print out the float. It will also accept or reject the floating point literals. If it accepts it will print out the float. If it rejects it will prompt the user that the inputted string is invalid and therefore will output reject. Then it checks if the user input is in scientific notation. If it is then it will build the float and output it.
